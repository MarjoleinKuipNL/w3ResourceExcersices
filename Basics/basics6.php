// 6. Write a simple PHP browser detection script.
// Web browse: A web browser is a software application for accessing information on the World Wide Web. 
//Each individual web page, image, and video is identified by a distinct URL. 
//These URLs, enable browsers to retrieve and display them on the user's device. 
//A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. 
// For a user, a search engine is just a website, such as google.com, that stores searchable data about other websites. 
//But in order to connect to and display websites on their device, a user needs to have a web browser installed.
